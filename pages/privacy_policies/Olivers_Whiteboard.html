    <h1>Oliver's Whiteboard Privacy Policy</h1>
    <article>
      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><strong>Last updated: January 15, 2025</strong></p>
      <p>Irie Development is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the Oliver's Whiteboard app.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Drawings:</strong> Oliver's Whiteboard allows you to create drawings on a digital canvas. These drawings are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> With your permission, the app can save your drawings to your device's photo library. We do not access, collect, or store any other photos from your library.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect basic device information (such as device type, operating system, and app usage data) to help us improve the app and ensure its functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or other identifying information.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the drawing functionality of the app.</li>
        <li>To save your drawings to your device's photo library (with your permission).</li>
        <li>To enable sharing features that allow you to share your drawings through other apps.</li>
        <li>To improve app performance and user experience.</li>
        <li>To respond to your inquiries and provide support.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Data Storage and Privacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your drawings are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your drawings or any other data stored on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> We do not upload, store, or process your drawings on any servers or cloud services.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> When you choose to save a drawing to your photo library, the image is saved directly to your device. We cannot access, view, or retrieve these saved images.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information or drawings to outside parties.</li>
        <li>Your drawings are only shared when you explicitly choose to use the app's sharing features, and this sharing is handled entirely by your device's operating system and other apps.</li>
        <li>We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
      <p>Since all your drawings are stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security settings. We do not transmit or store your drawings on any external servers, which means your drawings remain private and under your control.</p>
      
      <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
      <p>Oliver's Whiteboard is designed to be family-friendly and suitable for children learning to draw letters and numbers. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Parents should supervise their children's use of the app and ensure they understand how to use the sharing and photo saving features responsibly.</p>
      
      <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>The app may integrate with your device's built-in sharing and photo services. These services are provided by your device's operating system (iOS) and are subject to Apple's privacy policies, not ours.</p>
      
      <h3>8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app and on our website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

      <p>Oliver's Whiteboard may request the following permissions:</p>
